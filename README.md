This is the Project for VOIS_AICTE Internship




This project aims to analyse Airbnb hotel booking data to uncover patterns, trends, and insights that can help improve decision- making for hosts and enhancing the overall guest experience. By examining booking behaviours, pricing strategies, and guest preferences, and host performance, we seek to identify key factors that drive successful bookings and high guest satisfaction.
